;;;Today we learned that elves are really bad at making work plans.
;;;The plans, in this case, are pairs of ranges. We need to find out
;;;how many of these pairs fully or partially overlap.

;;;I misunderstood the second part, and spent a bunch of time figuring out how
;;;to check each range for overlap with every other range, not just the one
;;;it's paired with. Might want to go back and actually solve that. It's an
;;;interesting question and my first attempt double-counted a lot of cases.
;;;I'll probably find out that they all overlap. Even just looking at pairs
;;;it was 847 out of 1000. Like I said, whatever elf came up with this work
;;;plan wasn't very good at organizing this sort of thing.
