;;;This is too easy...
;;;The input is only 139 lines. I could probably solve this by hand.
;;;What will part 2 bring, I wonder?

;;;Update: Oh, it's one of these puzzles where the output spells out
;;;a word in giant latters. Those are always fun. I'll finish in the morning,
;;;but it looks like my approach to part 1 of making a vector containing
;;;the value of the x register during every cycle will set me up well for part 2
