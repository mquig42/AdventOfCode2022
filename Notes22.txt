Just going to hard-code part 2

Edges:
1 Left: Left side of 4, moving right. Top of 1 = bottom of 4
1 Top: Left side of 6, moving right. Left of 1 = top of 6
1 Right: no wrap
1 Bottom: no wrap
2 Left: no wrap
2 Top: Bottom of 6, moving up. Left of 2 = left of 6
2 Right: Right of 5, moving left. Top of 2 = bottom of 5
2 Bottom: Right of 3, moving left. Left of 2 = top of 3
3 Left: Top of 4 moving down. Top of 3 = Left of 4
3 Top: No wrap
3 Right: Bottom of 2 moving up. Top of 3 = left of 2
3 Bottom: No wrap
4 Left: Left of 1 moving right. Top of 4 = bottom of 1
4 Top: Left of 3 moving right. Left of 4 = top of 3
4 Right: No wrap
4 Bottom: no wrap
5 Left: no wrap
5 Top no wrap
5 Right: Right of 2 moving left. Top of 5 = bottom of 2
5 Bottom: Right of 6 moving left. Left of 5 = top of 6
6 Left: top of 1 moving down. Top of 6 = left of 1
6 Top: no wrap
6 Right: Bottom of 5 moving up. Top of 6 = left of 5
6 Bottom: Top of 2 moving down. Left of 6 = Left of 2

To put things on more precise terms:
If the next space is on the board, continue normally. If it isn't:
1L: If col = 51 and row < 51: New column 1, new row 151 - old row, new direction right
1T: If col < 101 and row = 1: New column 1, new row 100 + old col, new direction right
2T: If row = 1: new column is old column - 100, new row 200, direction unchanged (up)
2R: If col = 150, new column is 100, new row is 151 - old row, new direction left
2B: if row = 50, new column is 100, new row is old col - 50, new direction left
3L: if col = 51, new column is old row - 50, new row is 101, new direction is down
3R: If col = 100 and row < 101, new col is old row + 50, new row is 50, new direction up
4L: If col = 1 and row < 151, new col 51, new row 151 - old row, new direction right
4T: If row = 101, new col 51, new row 50 + old col, new direction right
5R: If col = 100, new col 150, new row 151 - old row, new direction left
5B: If row = 150, new col 50, new row is old col + 100, new direction left
6L: If col = 1, new col is old row - 100, new row 1, new direction down
6R: If col = 50, new col is old row - 100, new row is 150, new direction up
6B: If row = 200, new col is old col + 100, new row is 1, direction unchanged (down)
