;;;This looks like a difficult one. I see 2 main challenges here:
;;;1. represent the map in a way that allows wrapping
;;;2. Read and follow the instructions

;;;Reading the instructions was easier than I thought, thanks to regexes
;;;I'll store the direction (R or L) as an interned symbol instead of a string.
;;;That way I can use eq? to see which one it is, should be faster than string=?
