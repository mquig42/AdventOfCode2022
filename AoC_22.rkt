;;;This looks like a difficult one. I see 2 main challenges here:
;;;1. represent the map in a way that allows wrapping
;;;2. Read and follow the instructions

;;;Reading the instructions was easier than I thought, thanks to regexes
;;;I'll store the direction (R or L) as an interned symbol instead of a string.
;;;That way I can use eq? to see which one it is, should be faster than string=?

;;;Simple way of representing the board: a list of two sets, one for open tiles
;;;and one for walls. Direction is a coord pair representing a unit vector
;;;Using the same row/column coordinate system as the problem description,
;;;E = (0 . 1)
;;;S = (1 . 0)
;;;W = (0 . -1)
;;;N = (-1 . 0)

;;;For part 2, the wrapping rules are different. Need to figure out how to
;;;turn my input into a cube. Also, the sample and full inputs are different
;;;shapes, so if I want to work with both I need a general solution for folding
