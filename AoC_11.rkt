;;;A few thoughts: First, it doesn't matter in what order a monkey inspects
;;;its things. Everything in the queue will be looked at, one at a time
;;;This means I can use a stack instead of a queue.
;;;Second: I might want to use mutable vectors. They'll be faster.
;;;If I enclose all the mutable data inside a function, it's still FP, right?
;;;Third: I'm scared of part 2. This could be a day where part 2 is just
;;;"do part 1 a zillion times", and I'll need to find some math formula
;;;because conventional programming won't work on that scale.
