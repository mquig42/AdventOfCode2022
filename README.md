# AdventOfCode2022
 
Solutions to Advent of Code 2022. I had some fun learning Racket last year, so I'll keep using it this year. I still haven't finished day 19 from last year, so my goal this year is to get all 50 stars.

Self-imposed rules:
1. Each day's puzzle input will be stored in a text file. The program must be able to read and parse this file.
2. When possible, use purely functional programming. Avoid mutable state and side effects.
3. No looking at the subreddit until after I've got both stars for the day.
