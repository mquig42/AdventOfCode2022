;;;Another sensor/beacon puzzle, though simpler than the one that defeated me
;;;last year. There are only 32 sensors and 9 detected beacons. The difficulty
;;;is that they're spread over a very wide area, so checking every point
;;;would be too slow.

;;;Currently part 1 is done, but takes several minutes to check a single row
;;;Part 2 needs a more efficient approach.
